To address this, improve images using other tools\nbefore adding them to PDF documents.\nIf the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance.\nTo maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed\nthem within the PDF.\nYou can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding\nalternative text for images and proper content tagging.\nRefer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects\nin a PDF using Acrobat.",
