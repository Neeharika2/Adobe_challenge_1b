To understand the governing terms,\nreview Adobe's Generative AI User Guidelines. To understand Adobe's data handling\npractices, see Content usage and handling practices.\nThe AI-powered features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support multiple document types,\nincluding PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and RTF files. AI Assistant supports Microsoft Teams and\nZoom meeting transcripts. The capabilities improve comprehension and save time across\nvarious document types.\nAI Assistant quickly gets answers to your questions based on your documents in a\ncomprehensive and informative way. It can analyze multiple documents to uncover\nsimilarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests,\nsuch as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table\nsources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the\nprimary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more\naccurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information\naccurately from tables and complex documents.\nGenerative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to\nhighlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily\ncomprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks\nand simultaneously streams summaries.\nYou can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop\non both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google",
