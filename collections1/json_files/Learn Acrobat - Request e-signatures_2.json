Depending on how you've configured your application,\nvalidation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the\nauthenticity of the signature's digital ID certificate status and document integrity.\nTo verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are\ntrusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or\nAcrobat Reader settings.\nTo verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after\nsigning. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",
