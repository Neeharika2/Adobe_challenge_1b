      "context": "What's the best way to create a PDF?\nYou can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign(r)\nfiles, digital images, and more. Different types of sources have different tools available for PDF\nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in\nthe Print dialog box.\nIf a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft\nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is\nalready open, you don't have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF.\nEvery PDF balances efficiency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the\nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an\nappropriate conversion method.\nFor example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat\napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings.\nIf you want more control over the process, you'll want to use another method.",
